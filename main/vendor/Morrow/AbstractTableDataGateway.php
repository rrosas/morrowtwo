/**
* Extend this class to have Models following the Table Data Gateway pattern.
* 
* A Table Data Gateway holds all the SQL for accessing a single table or view: selects, inserts, updates, and deletes. Other code calls its methods for all interaction with the database.
* If you extend this class you write Models with less code because you don't have to take care of standard actions (see method listing below).
* 
* A database table accessed by this class must have a primary field `id`. If a table has a field `created_at` or `updated_at` of the type `DATETIME` it is automatically filled by the corresponding method.
* 
* Example
* ---------
*
* First you have to define your model, e.g. **App/Models/Products.php**
* 
* ~~~{.php}
* <?php
* 
* namespace App\Models;
* use Morrow\Factory;
*
* class Products extends \Morrow\AbstractTableDataGateway {
* 	protected $_db;
* 	protected $_table					= 'products';
* 	protected $_allowed_insert_fields	= array('title', 'description');
* 	protected $_allowed_update_fields	= array('description');
* 
* 	public function __construct() {
* 		$this->_db = Factory::load('Db');
* 	}
* 
* 	public function exampleAction() {
* 		$sql = $this->_db->get("SELECT *, >id FROM {$this->_table} ORDER BY id ASC");
*  		return $sql['RESULT'];
* 	}
* }
* ~~~
*
* This is a very simple class which is able to handle a table `products` as defined in `$_table`.
* The members `$_db` and `$_table` are both required. For this reason the `__construct()` method is also required because it fills the `$_db`  member.
*
* The other members `$_allowed_insert_fields` and `$_allowed_update_fields` are optional and define which fields are allowed to be inserted or updated.
* This prevents that e.g. an `id` is provided with the `update()` method what could destroy the integrity of your database.
*
* Most of the time you will have multiple model files so it will probably make sense to create a base model class.
* This is a simple example for such a class:
*
* ~~~{.php}
* <?php
* 
* namespace App\Models;
* use Morrow\Factory;
*
* class Base extends \Morrow\AbstractTableDataGateway {
* 	public function __construct() {
* 		$this->_db		= Factory::load('Db');
* 		$this->_table	= preg_replace('/^.+\\\\/', '', strtolower(get_called_class()));
* 	}
* }
* ~~~
*
* If the names of your database tables are the lower case written class names the first class would look like this:
*
* ~~~{.php}
* <?php
* 
* namespace App\Models;
* 
* class Products extends Base {
* 	protected $_allowed_insert_fields	= array('title', 'description');
* 	protected $_allowed_update_fields	= array('description');
* 
* 	public function exampleAction() {
* 		$sql = $this->_db->get("SELECT *, >id FROM {$this->_table} ORDER BY id ASC");
*  		return $sql['RESULT'];
* 	}
* }
* ~~~
*
* Now that you have your Table Data Gateway you can work with it in your controlller:
*
* 
* ~~~{.php}
* // ... Controller code
*  
* $products = new Models\Products;
*
* // insert some data
* $data = array(
* 	'title'			=> 'Cool product',
* 	'description'	=> 'A very long description ...',
* );
* $products->insert($data);
* $id = $this->lastInsertId();
* 
* // update the row just inserted
* $data = array(
* 	'description'	=> 'A very long and changed description ...',
* );
* $products->update($data, $id);
*
* // we do not need it anymore
* $products->delete($id);
* 
* // we defined a method ourself
* $data = $products->exampleAction();
*  
* // ... Controller code
* ~~~
*
* Every time you have `$conditions` (take a look at at the methods below) you can pass either an integer (which would be used for `WHERE id = $condition`) or an associative array (where all conditions would be concatenated with `AND`) which defines the `WHERE` clause in the resulting query.
