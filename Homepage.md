# Welcome #

This framework gives you the power to handle 95% of your website jobs very efficiently and is based on the principles of the Model-View-Controller architecture (MVC).
The goal of the MVC pattern is to provide for a flexible program design, that among other advantanges allows for changing and extending code easily and at the same time it promotes reusability.
Additionally, larger applications profit from the reduction of complexity and the clear and orderly structure of the architecture.

## Features ##

We decided not to write a big feature list with the absolutely out-standing features (every framework has), but we want you to keep two things in mind:

  1. A rich feature list does not say anything about the handling of the framework. You have to work with it every day so it should fit into your coding style.
  1. There is no such thing as THE framework. The choice of a framework is very subjective and depends first on the project you want to handle and second your own coding style und experience.


OK, some people simply need a feature list. Now, here is a list which shows what Morrow distinguishes from other frameworks:

  * Main focus on performance
  * i18n and l10n integration
  * Multi-site capable
  * Not only HTML can be outputted. There are additional view   handlers for: XML, JSON, CSV, Excel and Flash LoadVars files
  * Granular adjustable caching
  * Extensive form validation


## How to read ##

After installation you will work with the 'main' folder. Especially with '_templates' as the view component and '_controller' as the functional processing component of the MVC architecture.

Therefore you should start to read the ViewHandlers chapter of this documentation to understand, which different types of ViewHandlers are presented by the framework and how to use them by the given examples.

Please note that the fresh installation is using Serpent ViewHandler.
